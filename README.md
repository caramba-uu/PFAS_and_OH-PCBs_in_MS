# Associations of PFAS and OH-PCBs with Risk of Multiple Sclerosis Onset and Disability Worsening
In this paper we explore PFAS and OH-PCBs association with risk of multiple sclerosis onset as well as their association with confirmed disability worsening. 

## File Desscription
The [function.R](Code/functions.R) includes all custum functions used in this project. Analysis regarding PFAS/OH-PCBs association with sample collection year, age, sex, residential area, as well as differential expression analysis and Cox proportional hazard analysis were performed using [PFAS_and_OHPCBs_DataAnalysis.Rmd](Code/PFAS_and_OHPCBs_DataAnalysis.Rmd). Cox proportional hazard analysis were performed both in regards to confirmed disability worsening and risk of transitioning from relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) to secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS). Finally, PFAS/OH-PCBs association with multiple sclerosis onset was analysed using [Risk_of_MS_onset.Rmd](Code/Risk_of_MS_Onset.Rmd).
